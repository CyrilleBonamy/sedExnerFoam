@brief How to install sedExnerFoam

\tableofcontents

\section install_src_unix Compiling from source with supported OpenFOAM (last ESI version)

You need OpenFOAM to build the executable. sedExnerFoam versions released are named accordingly to OpenFOAM ESI versions. Currently the latest version is sedExnerFoam-2512.
<ul>
<li>First go to the <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/download">download</a> page of the software
<li><a href="https://www.openfoam.com/download/installation.php">Install OpenFOAM</a>.
</ul>

To take full advantage of sedExnerFoam the following additional tools should be installed.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/swak4Foam">swak4Foam</A> extension combines many fonctionalities and is needed for the tutorials
<li>Python usually comes pre-installed in Linux. However, if not installed or if you need a specific version, you can install Python with the following command:

        sudo apt install python3

<li>the python package
    <a href="https://github.com/fluiddyn/fluidfoam">fluidfoam</A>
    is needed for postprocessing of the tutorials.
</ul>

Compilation is now done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Download the official sedExnerFoam package:

        git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/sedfoam/sedExnerFoam

<li>Compile the program by running Allwmake:

        cd sedExnerFoam
        source $FOAM_ETC/bashrc # load the openfoam environment
        ./Allwmake

    The program should compile without problems and the binary
    <code>sedExnerFoam</code> and associated libraries
    should be available in the $FOAM_USER_APPBIN and $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN directories.

</ol>
