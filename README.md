# scourFoam

ScourFoam is an openFoam solver in development aiming at the numerical study of scour around hydraulics structures like bridge piles. The objectiv is to simulate the hydrodynamics and both the bedload sediment transport and the suspension of sediment.

# Repository

The repository is organized in different folders
- tutorials - OpenFoam cases to test and validate the code
- solver - all the files related to the solver
- src - all the librairies needed by the solver
